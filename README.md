# Joyce Kang - Data Science Portfolio
### This site is a station for me, Joyce Kang, to display both my genuine interest and deep love for <em>**data science**</em>.

Data science, which can loosely be defined as *the collection and analysis of large amounts of data*, is a mechanism that allows for a deeper understanding of how the world works, applicable in nearly every field. There are fewer things I love more than numbers and knowledge, thus the force I felt towards data science was irrestible. I plan on expanding this newfound love both within the academic scene and outside. Throughout the first half of this year, I aim to become closer with the art of using various programs and their features to **make numbers into meaningful reports** by learning the capabilities of programming and deciphering what makes a presentation powerful.

Below is a compilation of how I have grown in the data science field, demonstrated by my projects, relevant skills, education, etc.

## Projects
**Data Science Portfolio - (2024)** ðŸŒ·  
This portfolio is a collection of my earliest data science works completed during my time as a student enrolled in the course <em>Introduction to Data Science</em> as an undergraduate student at <em>the University of Notre Dame</em>.

<br>

**Tidy Data Project - (2025)** ðŸŒ»  
This repository includes my first steps into learning and understanding data wrangling and **data tidying** as a vital part of data science. The project contained within focuses on reorganizing the data on R&D spending by government departments into an organized, readable structure along with basic pivot tables created using the tidy data aimed to exemplify the purpose of tidying data. This project too is an extension of my journey into exploring data science as a student studying the subject at the <em> University of Notre Dame.</em> <br>
